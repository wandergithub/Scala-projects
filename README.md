# Mastering Scala by practice

Compilation of projects built to get confortable with Scala skills. And adquire at minimum a medium level of expertice.

Learning Scala through practical projects is an excellent way to gain proficiency in the language. Here's a roadmap of Scala project ideas ordered by increasing difficulty:

1. **Hello, World in Scala**
   - Start with the basics by creating a simple "Hello, World!" program in Scala. This will help you set up your development environment and get familiar with the syntax.

2. **Calculator**
   - Build a command-line calculator application that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

3. **To-Do List**
   - Create a console-based to-do list manager. Users should be able to add, delete, and list tasks. This project will introduce you to data structures like lists or arrays.

4. **File System Explorer**
   - Develop a program that allows users to navigate and interact with the file system. Implement basic file operations like listing files and directories, creating directories, and deleting files.

5. **Simple Web Scraping Tool**
   - Use Scala libraries like Akka HTTP and Jsoup to build a web scraping tool. Start with a basic task like extracting information from a single webpage.

6. **RESTful API**
   - Create a RESTful API using the Akka HTTP library. Implement endpoints for CRUD operations on a resource (e.g., a list of tasks, notes, or books).

7. **Concurrency with Actors**
   - Explore Scala's actor model by building a concurrent application. Consider a simple chat server, where users can send and receive messages concurrently.

8. **Database-driven Web Application**
   - Build a web application using a Scala web framework like Play or Akka HTTP. Connect it to a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) and implement features like user registration, login, and data retrieval.

9. **Real-time Data Processing with Apache Kafka**
   - Learn how to integrate Scala with Apache Kafka to process real-time data streams. Create a simple application that reads from a Kafka topic and processes the data in real time.

10. **Machine Learning with Scala**
    - Explore machine learning in Scala by implementing a basic machine learning algorithm (e.g., linear regression, k-means clustering) using a library like Breeze or Spark MLlib.

11. **Distributed Systems with Akka Cluster**
    - Dive into distributed systems by building a cluster of Akka actors. Create a distributed application that can handle failover and load balancing.

12. **Full-Stack Scala Web Application**
    - Develop a full-stack web application using Scala on the backend (e.g., Play or Akka HTTP) and a modern front-end framework like React or Angular. Implement user authentication, data storage, and interactive UI components.

13. **Compiler or Language Interpreter**
    - For a significant challenge, try building a simple programming language or a compiler for an existing language. This will require a deep understanding of language design and parsing.

14. **High-Performance Data Processing with Apache Spark**
    - Build a data processing application using Apache Spark and Scala. Process large datasets, perform complex transformations, and gain experience with distributed computing.

15. **Contributions to Open Source Projects**
    - Contribute to open-source Scala projects, such as the Scala standard library, libraries, or frameworks like Akka, Play, or Cats. This will expose you to real-world codebases and collaborative development.

Each project in this roadmap will help you build upon your Scala skills and tackle progressively more challenging tasks. Remember to document your code, seek feedback, and actively participate in the Scala community to accelerate your learning process.
